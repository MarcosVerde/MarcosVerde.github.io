# Marcos Verdejo Bosch

**Electronic Engineer** focused on **hardware design**, **embedded systems**, **IoT**, and **analog circuits**.

I enjoy developing efficient, reliable electronic systems that blend  
hardware precision with embedded intelligence. My work ranges from  
analog circuit design and power regulation to firmware for  
microcontrollers and IoT prototypes.

This site serves as a space to document selected projects, experiments,  
and technical notes.
