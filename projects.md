# Projects

A selection of engineering work and experiments.

- **Linear Voltage Regulator** — discrete 5 V / 3.3 V design, analog focus.  
- **IoT Sensor Node** — low-power ESP32 board with firmware in C.  
- 🧩 **Embedded Controller** — ARM-based board with real-time logic.  
- 💡 **Lab Utilities** — small Python and C tools for hardware testing.
